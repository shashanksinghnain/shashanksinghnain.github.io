I am a Pre-Doctoral Research Professional at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business, advised by [Prof. Luigi Zingales](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/luigi-zingales?_gl=1*6zie3z*_gcl_au*MTU1NTQ0NDQ4MC4xNjk5NDE4Njkx*_ga*MTg3ODQwMTc0My4xNjc0OTI4OTM0*_ga_PDRJWHFTEV*MTcwMzIxOTY4MC4yMzMuMS4xNzAzMjIxMzM3LjYwLjAuMA..&_ga=2.253703117.535278016.1703219680-1878401743.1674928934) at the [Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/stigler).

My research centers on the intersection of law and economics, my prior work has focussed on ingroup bias in judicial rulings and the impacts of pro-green judicial rulings on environment and child mortality. I am currently engaged in projects that delve into regulatory capture, antitrust, and conflicts of interest at the Stigler Center.

Previously, I completed my Integrated B.S. and M.S. from [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in), majoring in Economics with a Minor in Mathematics and Computing and a Micro-Specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Applications.

During my undergraduate studies I worked at the World Bank part-time for 3 years, where I was advised by [Prof. Daniel Li Chen](https://users.nber.org/~dlchen/) and [Prof. Shareen Joshi](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RYK7AAO/shareen-joshi).


Here is my [CV](https://shashanksinghnain.github.io/assets/pdf/shashank_cv.pdf), updated August 2023
