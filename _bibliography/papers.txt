Ideas},

  abstract={We conduct a survey of economists and a representative sample of Americans to
infer the reduction in the perceived value of a paper when its authors have conflicts
of interest (CoI), i.e., they have financial, professional, or ideological stakes in the
outcome of the results. On average, a CoI decreases trust in the conclusions of an
economics paper by 30%. This reduction in trust reflects a combination of the
frequency of conflicted papers and the bias of papers when they are conflicted. To
isolate the second term, we introduce a key construct: the CoI Discount, which
measures the reduction in the value of a conflicted paper relative to a nonconflicted one. We show that, on average, conflicted papers are worth less than
half of non-conflicted ones, though this effect varies significantly depending on the
nature of the conflict. The discount is more pronounced when the conflict involves
the interest of a private rather than a public entity. Restricted data access also leads
to a substantial discount. We validate our survey based estimates by comparing
them to actual biases observed in conflicted papers within the economics and
medical literature.},

  title = {Litigation as Scrutiny: A Four Decade Analysis of
Environmental Justice, Firms, and Pollution in India},
  author = {Bhupatiraju, Sandeep and Chen, Daniel L. and Joshi, Shareen and Neis, Peter and Singh, Shashank},
  abstract={Can judges enforce environmental justice? Though citizens increasingly rely on the judiciary to enforce environmental regulations, there is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of judicial policies in improving environmental outcomes. We report the first estimates of the causal effects of judicial orders on water pollution and infant mortality in India. We construct a comprehensive dataset spanning four decades that includes court cases, judicial decisions, pollution indices, and infant mortality rates. We leverage the quasi-random assignment of cases to judges in India’s courts, as well as the writing style of judges in prior cases. We find that ’green’ cases are temporally associated with reductions in peak toxicity levels, but have almost
no impact on infant mortality rates in subsequent months. Several years post-decision pollution
and mortality rates exceed pre-decision levels. This analysis highlights the potentially limited
effects of judicial environmental policies in high pollution settings such as India.},

  title = {Do Judges Favor Their Own Ethnicity and Gender? Evidence from Kenya},
  author = {Chen, Daniel and Graham, Jimmy and Ramos-Maqueda, Manuel and Singh, Shashank},
  abstract={Evidence from high-income countries suggests that judges often exhibit in-group bias, favoring litigants that share an identity with the judge. However, there is little evidence on
this phenomenon from the Global South. Collecting the available universe of High Court decisions in Kenya, this paper leverages the random assignment of cases to judges to evaluate the existence of in-group bias along gender and ethnic lines. It finds that, relative to a baseline win rate of 43 percent, defendants are 4 percentage points more likely to win if they share the judge’s gender and 5 percentage points more likely to win if they share the judge’s ethnicity. The paper finds that the written judgements are on average shorter and less likely to be cited when defendants who are
of the same gender or ethnicity as the judge win their case. This is consistent with in-group biased decisions being of lower quality. In addition, the findings show that female defendants are less likely to win the case if the judge exhibits stereotypical or negative attitudes towards women in their writings.},

  author = {Chen, Daniel and Graham, Jimmy and Ramos-Maqueda, Manuel and Singh, Shashank},
  abstract={Why do judges make biased decisions in favor of certain groups? In this article, we
examine the role of prejudiced attitudes in driving judicial bias. To do so, we construct
a novel dataset of over 150,000 cases from the Kenyan judiciary, use machine learning techniques to analyze written judgements and measure judges’ prejudice against
women, and leverage the quasi-random assignment of judges to cases to estimate a
causal effect of being assigned a prejudiced judge on outcomes for female litigants. We
estimate that for every one-standard-deviation increase in a judge’s prejudice score, female defendants’ probability of winning decreases by approximately 2 percentage points.
However, there is no effect for female plaintiffs. This research underscores the influence
of judicial prejudice on the equity and fairness in legal processes.},

  author = {Chen, Daniel and Graham, Jimmy and Ramos-Maqueda, Manuel and Singh, Shashank},
  abstract={Under what conditions do judges favor their own group? Collecting the available
universe of Superior Court decisions in Kenya, we leverage the random assignment of
cases to judges to evaluate the extent of judicial in-group bias along gender and ethnic
lines. We find that defendants are 4 or 6 percentage points more likely to win if they
share the judge’s gender or ethnicity, respectively, and that judges are significantly
more biased in favor of defendants than plaintiffs. Our findings highlight the need
to re-examine the emerging consensus that judges uniformly favor their own group
and continue investigating the mechanisms driving judicial bias. We propose that the
uneven application of bias can be explained by a framework of social identity and loss
aversion, and that this framework could serve as comprehensive lens through which to
decipher the cognitive underpinnings of judicial biases.},
