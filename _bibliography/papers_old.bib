  abstract={Can judges enforce environmental justice? Though citizens increasingly rely on the judiciary to enforce environmental regulations, there is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of judicial policies in improving environmental outcomes. We report the first estimates of the causal effects of judicial orders on water pollution and infant mortality in India. We construct a comprehensive dataset spanning four decades that includes court cases, judicial decisions, pollution indices, and infant mortality rates. We leverage the quasi-random assignment of cases to judges in India’s courts, as well as the writing style of judges in prior cases. We find that ’green’ cases are temporally associated with reductions in peak toxicity levels, but have almost
no impact on infant mortality rates in subsequent months. Several years post-decision pollution
and mortality rates exceed pre-decision levels. This analysis highlights the potentially limited
effects of judicial environmental policies in high pollution settings such as India.},

  title = {Do Judges Favor Their Own Ethnicity and Gender? Evidence from Kenya},
  author = {Chen, Daniel and Graham, Jimmy and Ramos-Maqueda, Manuel and Singh, Shashank},
  abstract={Evidence from high-income countries suggests that judges often exhibit in-group bias, favoring litigants that share an identity with the judge. However, there is little evidence on
this phenomenon from the Global South. Collecting the available universe of High Court decisions in Kenya, this paper leverages the random assignment of cases to judges to evaluate the existence of in-group bias along gender and ethnic lines. It finds that, relative to a baseline win rate of 43 percent, defendants are 4 percentage points more likely to win if they share the judge’s gender and 5 percentage points more likely to win if they share the judge’s ethnicity. The paper finds that the written judgements are on average shorter and less likely to be cited when defendants who are
of the same gender or ethnicity as the judge win their case. This is consistent with in-group biased decisions being of lower quality. In addition, the findings show that female defendants are less likely to win the case if the judge exhibits stereotypical or negative attitudes towards women in their writings.},
